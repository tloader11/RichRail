# Patterns and Frameworks Project
A public transport company has a little system with which they are administrating their trains and wagons.
The system has been very poorly designed and constructed (Â© Jeroen Weber - poor code and errors).
The code is not maintainable and full of errors. A redesign is required because new requirements have to be added.
Our goal is not to improve the current code but to start from scratch with a good design,
based on our design principles. The design comes with some problems for which proven solutions exist.

A train can be composed of several types of rolling components. 
Examples of these are: locomotives and wagons. At the time the system was built they only had 3 different types of rolling components, 
but now they want to be able to add more components. They also want the possibility of displaying their trains in different ways. 
To be more flexible in using the program it was decided to introduce a command line interface and a domain-specific language (DSL). 
Finally it should be fairly easy to extend the way of output details, like for example logging.
